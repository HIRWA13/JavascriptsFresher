# Basic Javascript Data Structures

-> in this directory I sumarize the basic data structures that can be found and used in javascript.

## Arrays:

-> Arrays are a data structure that can store multiple values in a single variable. They are created with brackets [] and can store any data type.

```javascript
let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length);
// logs 7 on the console.
```

## objects:

-> Objects are similar to arrays, but they use keys instead of indexes to access the data. Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects like a cat, a car or a house.
    
```javascript
let cat = {
    name: "Whiskers",
    legs: 4,
    tails: 1,
    enemies: ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```
