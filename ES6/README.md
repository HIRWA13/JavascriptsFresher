# Javascript ES6

-> this directory contains the Javascript ES6 fundamentals.

-> Below is the list of the topics that will be covered in this directory

## what is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, such as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript. It is standardized by the Ecma International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The language is widely used for client-side scripting on the web, in the form of several well-known dialects such as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript.

## what is ES6?

ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines is underway now.


## what's new in ES6?

### let and const

ES6 introduces two new ways to declare variables: let and const. These two new ways of declaring variables have some similarities to var, but they also have some important differences.


### arrow functions

Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous function expressions in ES6, and can be a replacement for the `function` expression syntax.

### default parameters

ES6 introduces a new way to set default values for function parameters. This is a very simple syntactic sugar that allows you to avoid repeating yourself by manually setting the default values in the function body.

### template literals

ES6 introduces a new way to define strings, using the backtick character (`) to create strings that can span multiple lines and have embedded expressions.

### destructuring

ES6 introduces a new syntax for destructuring objects and arrays. This syntax is similar to the syntax for creating object and array literals, but allows you to create variables that reference specific elements within those objects or arrays.

### rest and spread

ES6 introduces a new operator for handling variadic functions and variadic function calls. The rest operator (…) allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array, while the spread operator (…) allows you to represent an array as an indefinite number of arguments.

### for-of loop

ES6 introduces a new loop syntax, the for-of loop, which allows you to iterate over the values in an iterable object.

### classes

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining classes, which is syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model.

### modules

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining modules, which is syntactic sugar over the existing CommonJS and AMD module systems.

### promises

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining promises, which is syntactic sugar over the existing Q and Bluebird promise libraries.

### generators

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining generators, which is syntactic sugar over the existing co and regenerator libraries.

### maps and sets

ES6 introduces two new data structures, Map and Set, which are useful for storing collections of data.

### proxies

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining proxies, which is syntactic sugar over the existing Proxy polyfill.

### symbols

ES6 introduces a new primitive type, Symbol, which is useful for creating unique identifiers for objects.

### iterators

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining iterators, which is syntactic sugar over the existing Iterator polyfill.

### typed arrays

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining typed arrays, which is syntactic sugar over the existing TypedArray polyfill.

### new built-in methods

ES6 introduces a number of new built-in methods, which are useful for working with arrays, strings, and objects.

### new built-in properties

ES6 introduces a number of new built-in properties, which are useful for working with arrays, strings, and objects.

### number improvements

ES6 introduces a number of new features for working with numbers, including binary and octal literals, and new methods for working with integers.

### string improvements

ES6 introduces a number of new features for working with strings, including new methods for working with Unicode, and new methods for working with strings.

### array improvements

ES6 introduces a number of new features for working with arrays, including new methods for working with arrays, and new methods for working with arrays.

### object improvements

ES6 introduces a number of new features for working with objects, including new methods for working with objects, and new methods for working with objects.
